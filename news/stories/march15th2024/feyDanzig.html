    <h6>Rush hour in Danzig</h6>
    <p>There has been growing fear of the Fey since the fall of Italy. 
      With reports now of people disappearing without a trace this fear has become hysteria in the Free City of Danzig with store shelves often seen empty as hundreds are buying supplies for an apocalyptic event. 
      The authorities of Danzig have repeatedly asked the public to not jump to conclusions that this was the work of Fey but this has not reassured the public with many still preparing for war as they “aren't going the way of Italy” one resident told us. 
      We talked to a Danzig official on the topic. 
      They told us that the investigation is looking at multiple possibilities other than Fey work and that they just don't have the information right now to say anything conclusive and then the official introduced options like a serial killer or a Gnome or possibly a terrorist plot.
