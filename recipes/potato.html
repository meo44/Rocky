    <h3>
      Potatoes are what you get when you decide that fun is what you get when you degrade yourself into a bastard child.
      I know vegetables are meant to be unpleasant but couldnâ€™t someone notice that this one was undercooked.
      Like what were they thinking that eating something that can be considered as plain as cardboard is a net positive.
      Well I suppose I have to get on with this you know since you want to cook a potato for some reason.
      To cook them you need at least one potato and then just toss it into a boiler or whatever other heating mechanism you have till it is soft.
      Then you have cooked your unpleasant little starchy vermin of a vegetable.
